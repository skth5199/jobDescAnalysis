# Graduate data science job description analysis
This analysis was done to help me with my job search. My primary goal was to find the most desired keywords to help enhance my CV.

The jobs were scraped from Linkedin using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. The descriptions were then pre-processed, lemmatized and analysed.

Derived Insights:
* The most common word was Data which comes as no surprise. 
* The word team was also quite common, which shows how important team work is for securing and being successful at a job. 
* Despite the fact the search was for graduate roles, experience was still amongst the most desired requirements. This is slightly concerning. 
* Python, Machine learning, client, business, technology, solution, data science, product, support, development and time were some of the most occurring buzz words.
* The TF_IDF scores showed that the score of scientist is much higher than the score for analyst. The most plausible explanation for this is that the number of Data scientist roles was much higher than the number of data analyst roles. Similarly, there are a lot more senior role opportunities compared to junior opportunities.
